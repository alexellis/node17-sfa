  You've created a Single Function App (SFA) using Node.js for your function code
  and React JS for the front-end.

  The "react" subfolder hosts your ReactJS app, edit the files in src/ and 
  work with its package.json within that sub-directory.

  The root folder contains your function's handler.js file and its separate 
  package.json file.
